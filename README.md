ctrl F the big json "unchecked_event_array"     

~~"select_index" is the event outcome that gets picked in the smaller json~~

ok no it's mapped differently for every event but for most post race events select index of 1 means the good outcome (in the big JSON not the smaller one)

the safety of your account is not my problem. this will also never be implemented into sweepy. 

good luck you reckless fool
